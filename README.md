Our code is mainly based on HuggingFace's `transformers` libarary.

## Installation
The following command installs all necessary packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The project was tested using Python 3.7.

## Datasets
We used public datasets of subjective tasks that contain annotatorsâ€™ voting records from their original raw dataset <br>

- [Social Bias Corpus](https://maartensap.com/social-bias-frames/index.html) 
- [Social Chemistry 101](https://github.com/mbforbes/social-chemistry-101)
- [Scruples-dilemmas](https://github.com/allenai/scruples)
- [Dyna-Sentiment](https://github.com/cgpotts/dynasent)
- [Wikipedia Politeness](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/wiki_politeness.html)

You can load our processed version of disagreement datasets using Hugging Face's `datasets`, and you can also download the disagreement datasets in [datasets/](https://github.com/minnesotanlp/Quantifying-Annotation-Disagreement/tree/main/dataset) <br>
